By asking the client what they presently do to keep safe, the nurse is able to meet the patient where they are at and provide further education and information as needed. The nurse provided information about how to get treatment if and when the patient was ready. This allows the patient to know where to go for help and also provides the patient with another opportunity to engage in treatment without feeling coerced.",
